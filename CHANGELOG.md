  - Study guides, briefing docs, and reports
- Query/chat interface with conversation history support
- Research agents (Fast and Deep modes)
- Artifact downloads (audio, video, infographics, slides)
- CLI with 27 commands
- Comprehensive documentation (API, RPC, examples)
- 96 unit tests (100% passing)
- E2E tests for all major features

### Fixed
- Audio overview instructions parameter now properly supported at RPC position [6][1][0]
- Quiz and flashcard distinction via title-based filtering
- Package renamed from `notebooklm-automation` to `notebooklm`
- CLI module renamed from `cli.py` to `notebooklm_cli.py`
- Removed orphaned `cli_query.py` file

### API Changes
- Renamed collection methods to use `list_*` pattern (e.g., `get_quizzes()` → `list_quizzes()`)
- Split `get_notes()` into `list_notes()` and `list_mind_maps()`
- Added `get_artifact(notebook_id, artifact_id)` for single-item retrieval
- Old methods kept as deprecated wrappers with warnings

### Known Issues
- Quiz and flashcard generation returns `None` (may require further RPC investigation)
- RPC method IDs may change without notice (reverse-engineered API)
- Both quiz and flashcard use type 4 internally, distinguished by title
