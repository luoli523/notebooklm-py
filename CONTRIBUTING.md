## Documentation Rules for AI Agents

**IMPORTANT:** All AI agents (Claude, Gemini, etc.) must follow these rules when working in this repository.

### File Creation Rules

1. **No Root Rule** - Never create `.md` files in the repository root unless explicitly instructed by the user.

2. **Modify, Don't Fork** - Edit existing files; never create `FILE_v2.md`, `FILE_REFERENCE.md`, or `FILE_updated.md` duplicates.

3. **Scratchpad Protocol** - All analysis, investigation logs, and intermediate work go in `docs/scratch/` with date prefix: `YYYY-MM-DD-<context>.md`

4. **Consolidation First** - Before creating new docs, search for existing related docs and update them instead.

### Protected Sections

Some sections within files are critical and must not be modified without explicit user approval.

**Inline markers** (source of truth):
```markdown
<!-- PROTECTED: Do not modify without approval -->
## Critical Section Title
Content that should not be changed by agents...
<!-- END PROTECTED -->
```

For code files:
```python
# PROTECTED: Do not modify without approval
class RPCMethod(Enum):
    ...
# END PROTECTED
```

**Rule:** Never modify content between `PROTECTED` and `END PROTECTED` markers unless explicitly instructed by the user.

### Plan/Design Lifecycle

1. **Design docs** (`docs/designs/`) - Document the "why" behind major decisions; kept permanently. Format: `<feature-name>.md` (no date prefix).

2. **Implementation plans** - Tactical step-by-step plans; delete after task completion.

3. **Scratch files** (`docs/scratch/`) - Temporary work; periodically cleaned up. Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-<context>.md`

### Naming Conventions

| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Design docs | `<feature-name>.md` | `authentication.md` |
| Reference docs | `PascalCase.md` | `RpcProtocol.md`, `API.md` |
| Scratch files | `YYYY-MM-DD-<context>.md` | `2026-01-06-debug-auth.md` |

### Status Headers

All documentation files should include status metadata:

```markdown
**Status:** Active | Deprecated
**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD
```

Agents should ignore files marked `Deprecated`.

### Information Management

1. **Link, Don't Copy** - Reference README.md sections instead of repeating commands. Prevents drift between docs.

2. **Scoped Instructions** - See `docs/README.md` for folder-specific documentation rules.
